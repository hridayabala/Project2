            <h3>Skin Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Skin cancer is the one of the most common cancers in the United States. 
                To lower your skin cancer risk, protect your skin from 
                the sun and avoid indoor tanning.

            <p>

            <h3>Bone Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Bone cancer can begin in any bone in the body, but it most commonly affects the pelvis 
                or the long bones in the arms and legs. Bone cancer is rare, making up less than 1 
                percent of all cancers.

            <h3>Leukemia</h3>
            <p>
                Leukemia is a broad term for cancers of the blood cells. The type of leukemia depends on 
                the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly. 
                Leukemia occurs most often in adults older than 55, but it is also the most common cancer 
                in children younger than 15.

            <h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas â€” an organ in your abdomen that 
                lies behind the lower part of your stomach. This type of cancer is often detected late, 
                spreads rapidly, and has a poor prognosis. There are no symptoms in the early stages.

            <h3>Gastric Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Gastric cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lining of the 
                stomach. Age, diet, and stomach disease can affect the risk of developing gastric cancer. 
                Symptoms of gastric cancer include indigestion and stomach discomfort or pain.

            <h3>Kidney Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Kidney cancer develops when cells in your kidneys change and grow out of control. People 
                with kidney cancer may notice flank pain, high blood pressure, blood in their pee and 
                other symptoms. Kidney cancer treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
